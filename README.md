The project is divided into two parts, the <ISS> and the Cloud Analysis.

## ISS
In the first part, there is the material that was sent for the third phase of the competition, ie the program and the accompanying files that will be run on the ISS for the data collection.

## Cloud Analysis
In the second part, there is the material used for the analysis of the clouds in the requested categories ('parasol' and 'blankets'). In the first phase of the second part, the machine learning technology with the coral is utilized for the categorization of the images, according to the types of clouds. In the second phase, the images are analyzed with computer vision techniques, in order to measure the percentage of clouds in each category that cover the images.
